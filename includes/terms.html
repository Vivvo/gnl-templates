			<h1 class="gnl-header-4">Your privacy is important to us</h1>
			<p class="gnl-subtitle-1">The terms and conditions describe how we treat your personal information.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">By registering with MyGovNL, you agree to the terms of use below. If you choose not to accept the Terms of Use, you won’t be able to complete your registration for your MyGovNL profile.</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">Thank you for signing up for MyGovNL!</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">MyGovNL allows users to manage their online services such as their driver’s licence and vehicle renewals in one combined online platform, replacing several separate online functions.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				This policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it.
			</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">What information we have and where we get it</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">We collect and store information about you when you create an account.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				When you create your MyGovNL account, you voluntarily share certain information, including your name and email address.
			</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">How we use your information and why</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">We collect your information so that we can set up your MyGovNL account and manage your contact information in one consistent place. As you link to services, we use this information to validate against information that service has about you. This is to ensure we have the right person so that we can give you access to services available in MyGovNL.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				We collect your information to be able to send you personalized and relevant notifications regarding your upcoming renewals.
			</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				We may also send you messages and other information from time to time related to MyGovNL.
			</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">What you can update</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">You can update your email address and password that you use for signing in and receiving notifications.  This can be updated by visiting your Account page.</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">How and when we share your information</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">Information you provide through your MyGovNL profile is shared with the relevant department(s) that manage the service and to keep your contact information in one consistent place with Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				For example, if you renew your driver’s licence through MyGovNL, that information is provided directly to the Motor Registration Division so they know you have renewed your licence.
			</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">How long we keep your information</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">We keep your information (your name, email address and password) only as long as we need to in order to provide you with services under your MyGovNL profile.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				Service-specific information is kept for as long as that service requires it. This information is stored directly with the relevant department that manages this service.
			</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">Keeping your information up to date</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">It is important that you keep your MyGovNL account up-to-date with the latest and most relevant information so that we can provide you with the best service.</p>
			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">Your options</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">You can delete your MyGovNL account. By deleting your MyGovNL account, the information that is stored within MyGovNL will be deleted. If you delete your account, you are able to register at a later time but cannot reactivate your old account. If you have problems deleting your account, contact us by phone at <a class="gnl-link gnl-link--tel" href="tel:18776366867">1-877-636-6867</a> or by email at <a class="gnl-link gnl-link--mailto" href="mailto:mrd@gov.nl.ca">mrd@gov.nl.ca</a>.</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				Information relating to your services, like vehicle and driver’s licence, is not deleted if you delete your MyGovNL account. This is stored directly with the department providing that service.
			</p>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">
				You can revoke your consent to collect, use and share your personal information at any time by writing to <a class="gnl-link gnl-link--mailto" href="mailto:digitalgovernment@gov.nl.ca">digitalgovernment@gov.nl.ca</a>. If you revoke your consent, you will not be able to access your MyGovNL account and the connected online services and your account will be deleted.

			<h2 class="gnl-header-5">Privacy</h2>
			<p class="gnl-text-body-1">The information we collect about you is collected under the authority of section 61(c) of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015.</p>
